# Project descripion
Language classification is a crucial task in many fields, from natural language technology to speech recognition and machine translation. The rise of big data and the diversity of languages spoken around
the world have amplified the importance of having effective classification methods to process and analyze these data meaningfully.
In this context, evaluating and comparing the performance of classification algorithms is essential to identify the most suitable approaches for this complex task. This project aims to examine and compare the
quality of some of the most commonly used classification algorithms in language classification. In particular, we focus on evaluating the performance of Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) and Random Forests
Classifiers.

The main objective is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each classification algorithm in the specific context of language classification. 
To achieve this, we will use representative datasets containing voice samples from different people (with varying genders and age groups) covering a variety of linguistic structures and features. 
We will assess the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
